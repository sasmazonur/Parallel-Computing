# OpenMP: Monte Carlo Simulation
This project, will take a scenario and develop a Monte Carlo simulation of it, determining how likely a particular output is to happen. Monte Carlo is used to determine the range of outcomes for a series of parameters, each of which has a probability distribution showing how likely each option is to happen.

Figure 1. A laser is pointed at a circle (circle, in this case). The circle is defined by a center point (xc,yc) and a radius (r). The beam comes out at a 30Â° angle. It bounces off the circle. Underneath, even with the laser origin, is an infinite plate.

### Findings:
The best performance achieved at 100000 Trials with 8 threads. The probability that the beam hits the plate is 0.13.

### Eight to one thread speedup:
S = 77.92/9.9 \
S = 7.87

### Parallel Fraction For 1-Thread-To-8-Threads Speedup
Fp = (8/7)*( 1- (1 / 7.87) ); \
Fp = 0.9976

To run on Server:
./run_bash_server.sh

To run on MacOS
./run_bash_maxos.sh

It will generate output.csv file with desired outputs.
