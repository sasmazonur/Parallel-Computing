# Parallel-Computing
This course is all about parallel programming on the desktop for applications that you are attempting to accelerate to improve user interaction and simulation and computational performance
The goals of this course are to leave you “career-ready” for tasks that require desktop parallelism, both on a CPU and a GPU. 

## Topics include:

* Parallel computing: types, limitations
* Moore's Law
* Amdahl's Law
* Multithreading -- OpenMP
* Synchronization issues in parallel computing -- race conditions, deadlock
* Cache issues in parallel computing -- false sharing
* SIMD vectorization on CPUs
* GPU programming
* CUDA
* OpenCL
* Message Passing Interface (MPI)







This course is being taught by: Professor Mike Bailey
